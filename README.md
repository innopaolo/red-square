# Red Square

[Live Demo](https://innopaolo.github.io/red-square/)

This is one of my earlier projects, salvaged from my old laptop. It's a sample website from Frontend Mentor that can be replicated. I reimagined Red Square as an advertising agency led by a ruthless band of orcs from Lord of the Rings.

While the code may not be overly complex, I  remember the hours spent wrestling with CSS, tackling issues like alignment, centering, and responsiveness that seem trivial to me now. I was also, at this point, still using `var` in JavaScript.

This project includes a bit of JavaScript code embedded within the HTML file. At the time, this approach seemed convenient for handling image paths. In hindsight, I've come to appreciate the importance of best practices and code separation, which I now prioritize in my subsequent projects.

Although it may not be flawless, revisiting this project serves as a nice reminder of how much I've progressed on my journey as a developer. Each line of code represents a valuable lesson learned and a stepping stone towards becoming a more proficient programmer.
